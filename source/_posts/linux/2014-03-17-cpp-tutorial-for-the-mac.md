If you want to compile a C++ program that includes self-defined header files on Mac or other Linux environment. We suggest you the following two ways to do that. One way is using g++ to compile and run programs in terminal (Recommended). Another way is using Xcode to new a project (i.e., a file with filename extension *.xcodeproj*).
Here, we provide two *cpp* files, and one *header* file to you for demonstrating how you can run it on Mac. Just the same as windows’ Dev-C++. Download [example code](https://github.com/evenchange4/102-2_PD_Cpp-Tutorial-for-the-Mac/archive/master.zip) that was mentioned in the class.

## Using Commands in Terminal (Recommended)
In Figure 1, find terminal in the Spotlight results, and then click it to open a new Terminal windows (Figure 2).

Before starting, some basic knowledge you need to know is about unix-like system command-line commands. Here we list some useful commands.
First, we need to change directory `cd path` to the right one which your code is available under this folder. We assume that the codes are under the path

** *~/Downloads/project* **

And then we need to to switch our path to the destination path of project.

```
$ cd Downloads/project
```

Then we type the command below to list `li` what files are under the folder project.

```
$ ls
```

And, we can compile our C++ codes as below. The two cpp files will be linked together automatically (i.e., It links all the object files that are separated by a white space.).  Here we will get one executable file (e.g., run). `-o filename` is an argument of output file name.

```
$ g++ main.cpp myMax.cpp -o run
```

Finally, execute `./program` the program, and the results will be printed on the Terminal windows. The above steps are shown in Figure 3.

```
$ ./run
```

## Using Xcode
We use the Xcode in Mac which is almost the same as windows’ Dev-C++. In Figure 4, we create a new Xcode project, and then select the ** *OSX > Application > Command Line Tool* ** option (Figure 5).

In Figure 6, you need to name the product first, and keep the product type as C++ (of course).  Then, we put all of the downloaded source codes in the project, but we need some tips to do that. Now, create two empty files manually (***File > new > File***), and those will be your *cpp* file and *header* file (Figure 7 and Figure 8).

![▲ Figure 8: Those are your cpp file and header file.](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/7c/87/387c8791e7deb2c373f9e082eb6e5efd.jpg)

Finally, we can execute your project, and we will get the results in the console window in the bottom of Xcode (Figure 9).

## 後記
第一次用英文打這種 Tutorial，因為當了 全英文授課的 PD 助教所以需要全英文的文件，希望一學期過後破爛的英文可以稍微有些長進ＱＱ 特別感謝 Lynn 從旁協助。
