For the course of NTU [Programming Design, Spring 2014](http://www.im.ntu.edu.tw/~lckung/courses/PDSp14/)

If you want to compile a C++ program that includes self-defined header files on Mac or other Linux environment. We suggest you the following two ways to do that. One way is using g++ to compile and run programs in terminal (Recommended). Another way is using Xcode to new a project (i.e., a file with filename extension *.xcodeproj*).
Here, we provide two *cpp* files, and one *header* file to you for demonstrating how you can run it on Mac. Just the same as windows’ Dev-C++. Download [example code](https://github.com/evenchange4/102-2_PD_Cpp-Tutorial-for-the-Mac/archive/master.zip) that was mentioned in the class.
